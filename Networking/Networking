########## ping command

The /usr/sbin/ping command sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ECHO_REQUEST to obtain an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway. The ping command is useful for:

Determining the status of the network and various foreign hosts.
Tracking and isolating hardware and software problems.
Testing, measuring, and managing networks.
If the host is operational and on the network, it responds to the echo. Each echo request contains an Internet Protocol (IP) and ICMP header, followed by a ping PID and a timeval structure, and enough bytes to fill out the packet. The default is to continuously send echo requests until an Interrupt is received (Ctrl-C).
